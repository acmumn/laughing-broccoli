## Minutes
- MinneHack schedule on website
  - Charlie: How did we set up the schedule last time?
  - Andrew: I think it was just an ordered list. You can check git history
  - Charlie: Could you put up the schedule with the dates we know already?
  - Andrew: Is that in an email chain?
  - Charlie: yeah, there's a pdf in an email you were all copied on
  - Andrew: Ok
- MinneHack prizes
  - Charlie: We have prizes listed for 1st 2nd and 3rd place, but I thought we were having prizes for the winner of each prompt
  - Louis: Could we just number the prompts 1 2 and 3?
  - Charlie: I think we should have prizes that are roughly equal value for each prompt
- minnehack.com renewal notice
  - Charlie: We got an email saying minnehack.io is expiring in 24 hours
  - Mike: I thought that was minnehack.com
  - Mike: Were we letting it lapse on purpose?
  - Louis: We bought it just to have it redirect, idk how important that actually is though
  - Charlie: Hemant, can you check that it's actually getting renewed?
  - Cole: Didn't our namecheap card expire?
  - Kelton: No, I thought I updated that
  - Charlie: Can you make sure?
  - Kelton: Yeah, sure
