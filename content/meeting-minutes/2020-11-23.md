## Minutes
- Sponsorship values
  - Charlie: We need to decide on sponsorship tiers for MinneHack
  - Charlie: Since we're not doing in person the entire cost of the event is about 1/5 of what it would be
  - Cole: What are the expenses we still have?
  - Charlie: Just the prizes, I think. Which is our next topic
  - Mike: Do we want to spend more, less or the same on prizes?
  - Charlie: I think if we spend more, it will make more people participate
  - Mike: Makes sense to me
  - Cole: What did we spend on prizes last year?
  - Cole: Ok I'm seeing here that it was about $6,000
  - Cole: Our MinneHack account is at $9,237.53 right now
  - Mike: Didn't we already get some companies asking us if they can sponsor us again?
  - Charlie: Yeah, we got a few emails
  - Charlie: One problem is that there's no real reason to sponsor at the gold level over silver since there are no booths
  - Charlie: We could have gold get mentors and judges, silver just gets logo and resumes, bronze gets [i didn't hear this part]
  - Charlie: That way we still have four tiers
- Prizes
  - Mike: What were the prizes last year again?
  - Charlie: 
    - 1st: keyboard, monitor, mouse headphone ($730 per person)
    - 2nd: switch, joycons, eshop gift card ($480 per person)
    - 3rd: oculus go ($200 per person)
    - Total was 6000 even
  - Charlie: We should budget an extra $1000 for smaller competitions on the twitch stream
  - All: Sounds good
- The MinneHack "Experience"
  - Louis: I think we should think about what the competitor experience would be, before we think about prizes
  - Louis: Like should we have a twitch stream that rotates between us, or sponsor run segments, or competitors
  - Louis: And/or we could have discord voice channels/"rooms" that people could pop in and out of to see whats up
  - Hemant: Well, I was planning on doing things on Zulip (sic?), but sure
  - Louis: What the fuck is that?
  - Hemant: It's an open-source slack knock-off, but not bad
  - Louis, Charlie, others: Seriously dude, nobody is going to use this thing
  - Louis: At most they'll join if they're forced to and then do a discord chat on their own
  - Hemant: I just don't wanna force people to use Discord, I don't see a problem with people doing their own thing on their own
  - Mike: The problem is that this an online event, and if people aren't interecting outside of their teams then what's the point?
  - Hemant: Ok, but last year people didn't talk accross teams in the discord anyway
  - Louis: That's because it was in-person and people could talk to other teams/mentors in-person
  - Hemant: Ok, well if someone else wants to set up the discord thing you can, but I don't wanna touch it
  - Louis: I think we should have a bridge for people who don't wanna use discord, but if we don't have a central discord it's going to be a problem
- MinneHack timeline
  - Louis: Does it have a date?
  - Charlie: Yeah, Saturday the 23rd of January
  - Louis: If we're gonna try to have some type of engagement/twitch stream, that wouldn't have to go overnight
  - ideas for things in the twitch stream:
      - minecraft speedrun
      - groups talk about their project progress
