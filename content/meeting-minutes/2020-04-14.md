## Minutes
- Charlie: minnehack@umn.edu group type
  - Mike: I'd like more of us to be here before we make a decision
  - Charlie: I don't think we can make that decision at all, Google changed how groups works so it's not compliant with what it says on the U's website. We'll need to email someone about it
- Mike: LAN party
  - Mike: Has anyone been in contact with IEEE or the gamers?
  - Charlie: I think individual people from UMN eSports were going to do something but not officially
  - Charlie: If it's not in person there's not really much for us to do, I think we should just let them do their thing
- Mike: Paper pals
  - tabled for this week because Helen's not here

## Things to say
- If you continually do not do your tasks, please ask someone to do them. It is better to have someone a little bit grumpy at you than for them not to get done.
