- What are we actually doing?
  - Louis: We should talk about why people would actually want to be in this club
  - Charlie: At one point we worked out a list of what events we're still planning on doing
  - Louis: I just mean we should start scheduling events and updating the website
  - Charlie: I'm still working on the resume event with target and sdc with cat
  - Charlie: Other than that we can just decide on days for the events
  - Abridged notes from prev meeting:
    - SDC: Can be done online
    - Donuts with the department: Cancel
    - UNIX classes: Can be done on twitch

    - Paper pals: Do over discord

- GopherLink transition
  - Charlie: They're redoing gopherlink and they need us to download stuff before 9/30
  - Mike: Is there one button we can click to download everything?
  - Charlie: No, you have to download every thing one by one
  - Charlie: I nominate the webmaster
  - Andrew: Alright :(
- SSF disaster
  - Kelton: There are no purchases in the ledger after halloween last year, we're working on tracking down purchase requests
  - Kelton: There's been a whole chain of stuff we can't fill out because of that
  - Kelton: We met with Sara earlier, and it sounds like it's not the worst thing to ever happen, as long as we eventually turn in the spending report
- Organizing a CTF, timing
  - Kelton: We need to figure out how to run a CTF all online, and start writing questions
  - Hemant: Michael says he's interested in helping out
  - Andrew: It should be pretty easy to run a ctf online, just use ctfd
  - Louis: ctfd sucks
  - Kelton: What did we do last time?
  - Hemant: ctfd, which i would prefer not to do again
  - Louis: It should be fine if we all write a few questions
  - Hemant: I can do a few, I just don't want to like 10
  - Hemant: ctf can just be a txt file on nginx with an upload button
  - Hemant: Now that we have argo set up, we can have problems on VMs
  - Hemant: We can have a competition to see who can be the first one to hack a vm
  - Louis: I like that more than a jeopardy style ctf
  - Kelton: We should do that next semester, since we're already committed to doing jeopardy style this semester
  - Hemant: ok
- Announce membership fee cancellation
  - Mike: I will do this now that we've talked about it
- Advertise SDC to classes
  - Charlie: We need to do this
  - Mike: How does this work with online classes
  - Charlie: We arrange to drop in on classes
  - Louis: We could prerecord something and have the prof play it
  - Kelton: That sounds like way less work
  - Charlie: Ok yeah, someone could record a video with info on what CTF is and when it'll be, etc
  - Kelton: Who wants to do that?
  - Everyone: Oh, not me
  - Charlie: I am drafting Cole
  - Cole: Why don't we do a write up and put in on canvas?
  - Andrew: Nobody's gonna read that
  - Cole: :(
  - Cole: When does that need to be done by?
  - Charlie: Unclear, we don't know when SDC is yet
- Schedule ~~SDC~~ events
  - SDC (w/ CAT Digital): Date TBD
    - Charlie: We should look at this today and then send some options to CAT
    - Charlie: I don't think we're planning on doing it in September
    - Charlie: I told the CAT guy "early mid semester" and then I told him October or early November
    - Charlie: How about Friday at 5?
    - Mike: That works, but will people be less likely to come on a Friday?
    - Charlie: I think that's less of a problem with our target demographic
    - Louis: I think we should have buffer time before and after the event for people to hang out and talk
    - Charlie: Weekly starting on Friday, 10/18 (1 month from this friday)
  - Resume and interview prep event (w/ Target): September 25th
    - Charlie: This one should be announced during the freshmen student group event since it will be 0-1 days later.
    - Andrew: The student group event is also thinking about being on the 25th, sometime before 5:00
    - Charles: so we should do some time after 5:00 on the 25th
  - CTF:
    - Charlie: how about 2 weeks after SDC?
    - Everyone: sure

  - Hemant: Cerberus will also probably be redone at some point, but not now
- Indefinite membership for officers
  - Hemant: Cole, Kelton, and I were thinking that officers should get 100 years of free membership to make up for not getting stipends
