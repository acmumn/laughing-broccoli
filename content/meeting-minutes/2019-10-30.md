  - Helen: we need a poster.
  - Louis: letter grid
  - louis: never mind
  - Helen: pretty picture

  - Nathan: I don't think that they are a blatantly terrible company.

  - Nathan: we should solidify our MinneHack budget a little more. Calling people, getting estimates, etc. I think we should start doing that now. We should talk about this during MH meeting.
- Nathan: Bus planning
  - Nathan: the department did not like bus last year. They want us to get that done asap, starting now. I can talk to them about going through them.
  - Helen: I believe we didn't go through them because we didn't know about it. There is no reason for us to not go through them, as long as it is cheaper.
