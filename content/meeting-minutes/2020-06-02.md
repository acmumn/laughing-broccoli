  - Mike: I think so. Communication is good.
- Link wall in general

  - Charlie: We could also make a public health channel for coronovirus related links
  - Cole: We could message him and say
  - Cole: There should be a company role, for transparency
  - Mike: Should we message him and put those things somewhere else?
  - Cole: I think we should have hime edit this one and put future ones in interest groups
  - Mike: I don't know if we want to allow this one to stay, it sets a bad example about comapanies promoting in general
  - Cole: Sounds good

## Things to say
- If you continually do not do your tasks, please ask someone to do them. It is better to have someone a little bit grumpy at you than for them not to get done.
