## Minutes
- Welcome week flip grid
  - Mike: We got an email from Ben Koch asking us to fill out a form and sign up for their flip grid. should we do that?
  - Charlie: I haven't looked at it, it looks like we're posting videos, not having a live coversation
  - Mike: That sounds really contrived and awful
  - Charlie: I can look at it and see if it's something I personally want to do
  - Kelton: The example is just some text describing our group, which doesn't sound too bad
  - Charlie: It looks like we can just copy paste most of this stuff. I can do this today
  - Kelton: I get the feeling most people won't do this because they aren't forced to
- CSE orgs update
  - Mike: There's also a line in that email asking us to update our contact info for the new school year
  - Charlie: That should still be fine, since the email was just sent to acm
  - Mike: That's probablyu true but I'll still look at the form just in case
- Server closet keys
  - Kelton: We haven't transferred server keys yet. it's not a big deal but it should happen some time
  - Charlie: We should at least collect the keys from people who still have them but shouldn't
  - Mike: Who still has those keys?
  - Charlie: There's a spreadsheet, I'll look
  - Charlie: Louis, Helen, Ashmita and Nathan still
  - Charlie: I can drive out to Louis and get his key, he's only 30 minutes from st paul
  - Mike: I can message Helen and Ashmita and ask them to lock their keys in the closet
  - Charlie: I'll message Nathan as well
  - Cole: If Louis is east of St Paul I can also go get it from him, I'm probably closer
