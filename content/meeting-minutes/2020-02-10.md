## Minutes
- Charlie: Secretary vs treasurer
  - Charlie: I don't remember if I said this last week, but I think the secretary role isn't very significant
  - Charlie: I think we should have a treasurer jr instead
  - Nathan: Sue is a fan of this, she wants more people helping with treasury
  - Hemant: I thought secretary was just supposed to be a general role
  - Charlie: My point is that treasurer is a big role, and it would be good if Nathan had help
  - Louis: As always, I don't see the point of removing roles, it's fine if we add a treasurer jr without eliminating secretary
- Charlie: Constitution PR
  - Charlie: I made a PR to rename ACM to ACM UMN officially
  - Charlie: We agreed on it last week, but we do still have to vote on it
  - **Vote, unanimous aproval**
  - Louis: If we're changing our name, I think it would be smart to leave in language that we may also be refered to as the old thing
- Mike: Restocking
  - Mike: the last of the gauze was used up today. we should also make an assessment of other supplies and replenish.
  - Mike: Is there anything else specific we can think of right now?
  - Charlie: Blue painter's tape
  - Mike: We're almost out of powdered coffee creamer
  - Mike: I also put waffle supplied on there as a reminder, but I'm not sure if the U will pay for it
  - Nathan: I definitely want to put a waffle maker in ops requests
  - Charlie: We're running low on toner
  - Helen: Tissues
  - Cole: Disinfectant wipes?
  - Charlie: Idk how important this is, but we only have 3 surgical masks left
  - Charlie: Do we still have a materials mask?
  - Helen: The ones I bought were single use, and I'm not sure where the other one went / if it's still here
- Mike: Battlestation
  - Mike: Someone broke the battlestation and I would like it to be fixed so I can game
  - Cole: The old install is still on there, you can just boot into it
  - Cole: We just need Louis to set up networking on the new install
  - Louis: Fine, I'll do that right now
- Mike: Server closet
  - Mike: There's a filing cabinet just over there, and it should be in the closet
  - Cole: We can try to find a place for it, but we should maybe just try to find new places for the contents
  - Charlie: And once we do that we can just have the cabinet out here for storing files
  - Louis: I second that idea
- Misc
  - Helen: I picked paper pals days. They are 3/20 and 4/17 from 5:00 to 6:30
  - Helen: I also reserved the room
  - Louis: I emailed Kelly about the TA tables during the meeting also
  - Cole: Louis, can you update event times, dates, and locations for UNIX classes in the spreadsheet?
  - Louis: What the damn is that? Yeah whatever
  - Cole: Oh also, we should get bolts for the server rack

## Things to say
- Talk to your (cool) CSCI professors about Donuts
- If you continually do not do your tasks, please ask someone to do them. It is better to have someone a little bit grumpy at you than for them not to get done.
