## Minutes
- Key update
  - Helen will get her key to us whenever is convenient
  - Mike has not asked ashmita yet
  - Charlie messaged louis, no response
  - Nathan returned his key :)
- Resume event
  - Charlie: I think it's still worth it to do the resume event, since they're still doing the career fair
  - Charlie: Even if it's just a company rep giving a talk about interviews it'll still be helpful to being who are going
  - Cole: Is the career fair still in person?
  - Charlie: No, it's online
  - Mike: I think it's a good idea, was the CAT guy interested in hosting?
  - Charlie: Not specifically, but I gave him the info
  - Mike: We've done it with Target the last year or two, we could message them too
