- Helen: Local hack day
  - Helen: we got an email from mlh, its a thing that happens in october. It sounds like SDC.

  - *General concensus of paid energy*

  - Need to pay (EFS string form)
  - Mike: we got 31-34 names.

  - Helen: We can also put it in the discord and write it on the whiteboard
- Helen: resume event retro (brief)
  - Helen: yesterday we did the event, and it went really well. It ended up being 20 ish people. if we do a similar event, we will order less pizza and make it a smaller event.
