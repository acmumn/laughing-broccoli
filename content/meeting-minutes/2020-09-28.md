## Minutes
- Putting social hour on website
  - Kelton: We should do this, I got some questions about when we meet at the student groups panel
  - Mike: Are our normal meeting times on the website either? I think that should be there too
  - Andrew: I think we should rewrite all the references to the room to be about discord instead, at least temporarily
- New newsletter
  - Kelton: We should be sending more newsletters to let people know about events
  - Mike: I agree, I can send one out about UNIX classes after the meeting
- UNIX classes
  - Mike: I think we should advertise them
  - Kelton: We can just send out an email and ping people on discord
  - Hemant: when are UNIX classes again?
  - Mike: Tomorrow, but since we haven't formally announced them we could push them back
  - Cole: It looks like if we push them back further than one week, there'll be too much overlap with other events
  - Kelton: I have some free time, I could take over for just this first class
  - Andrew: I think the main issue is not having advertised them, aside from the student group panel
  - Kelton: Oh that's true, we did announce unix classes at the panel. In that case I'd rather do them tomorrow
  - Kelton: what platform are we using this year?
  - Hemant: I was going to have people join a discord voice channel and use tmux instead of screen sharing
  - a lot of arguing about terminals
  - Mike: Ok, who is doing the first UNIX class?
  - Andrew: I think it's best to just move it back, we don't have time to plan it tonight
- Paper pals update
  - Kelton: Lucas will be there to give a short talk about the paper
  - Charlie: Cool
  - Kelton: They should also be on the website
