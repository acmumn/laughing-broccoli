## Minutes
- Charlie: Louis's garbage
  - Louis: What garbage
  - Charlie: All of the old switches and hubs that you have sitting around
  - Charlie: You can keep one here, but the garbage servers also need to leave
  - Can we give them to IEEE?
  - Hemant: This sounds good, it's like the circle of life
  - Helen: Louis, please put something in discord about them
  - Louis: Also I don't know who that tower belongs to
  - Helen: I think it might be Neil's; I'm facebook friends with him and I can message him
  - Mike: Include a picture
- Louis: Bookstack
  - Cole: Bookstack is our new wiki software and it's very helpful, officers should work on updating their info
  - Helen: That should be something that we do very soon
  - Cole: Louis can you figuire out the config file to do Draw.io integration and fix the uploads
  - Louis: Long term knowledge that would be useful in the future like how to reserve a room
  - Louis: Some keybase stuff that can be public will also be brought over to Bookstack
  - Helen: What items would that include?
  - Louis: We have three classes of objects in keybase and drive. (1) photos and stuff, that can stay. (2) working documents that get updated during a "minnehack season"/year. these stay. (3) long-term knowledge documents that mostly get referenced. these get moved.
- Louis: (Backups)
  - Louis: Everything in the rack that's owned by ACM should be backed up at the moment
  - Hemant: We could rclone backups to S3 or Google Drive
  - Louis: Google Drive sounds like a good idea since we have unlimited storage through the University
- Cole: Password manager
  - Hemant: Are we using BitWarden?
  - Charlie: No, it costs money each month for team usage, Passbolt is a good alternative
  - Cole: Louis can you set that up to be locally hosted?
  - Louis: Sure.
- Cole: Mail server
  - Charlie: I think the only thing we need out of the mail server is to send mail
  - Louis: I would like to set up something like MailCcow that has more features (IMAP & Webmail)
  - Hemant: Mail-in-a-Box sounds like a good solution
  - Charlie: Does it have CAN Spam/mailing list features?
  - Louis: No, that's outside the scope of what it's supposed to do. That wouldn't be hard to setup on top of IMAP though (probablyTM)
  - Helen: I'll make it a joint Louis and Hemant task
- Nathan: TigerGraph
  - Nathan: TigerGraph wants to do a think talk and buy us pizza
  - Helen: When are they available?
  - Nathan: Not sure
  - Helen: This is fine, they seem like a good company. Who is talking to them right now?
  - Nathan: Nobody
  - Charlie: I will be mailing them since that's my job
  - Helen: Pick a date, pick a room, get posters going and good
- Louis: Advertising to classes (Unix classes and open houses)
  - It's not in Lind40, it's in CivE230
  - Helen: I will make poster
  - Cole: Should we mass email CSCI professors to have them advertise the events?
  - Helen: Yes, we have a spreadsheet of all of them that we can use for this
  - Charlie: We should target 1113, 1133, 1913, 1933, 2021, 2041
  - Cole: Who's talking to who?
  - Charlie: We will claim professors from the spreadsheet
  - Helen: I have aquired the list and will make spreadsheet. I'll bother people about it when the sheet is ready.
  - Ashmita: I can make the posters for the event
  - Helen: I can do that, I have a cool website
- Nathan: Class registration event
  - Nathan: SSF kinda said yes, they kinda said no. The event still has to allign with what we originally wrote. We can't "officialy" change it to something else
  - Nathan: We are going to just have a registration event
  - Helen: We are no longer doing a class registration event. We will now "hop onto" ACM-W's event
  - Ashmita: Yay! 
- Mike: Lost and found cart
  - Mike: The stuff on the cart has been there since MinneHack so I will cause us to stop having it now
  - Helen: If you see someone put organic items on the lost and found cart, kill them on the spot
  - Mike: Yeah, take the heaviest thing you can find and hit them on the back of the head
  - Helen: Yeah, then put their corpse on the cart
  - Helen: Basically stop using the lost and found as a staging area for the trash
- Nathan: Ledger update
  - 

## Things to say
- Talk to your (cool) CSCI professors about Donuts
- If you continually do not do your tasks, please ask someone to do them. It is better to have someone a little bit grumpy at you than for them not to get done.
