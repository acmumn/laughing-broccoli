     - Isai: We came up with an idea where we could have faculty pie each other in the face, and the money would go to student scholarships

     - Isai: I talked to Hannah about it, but I haven't emailed back

     - Cassie: Update: you're right, we only have to do it every three years
 - Ari: ACM honor code
     - Louis: Was there a specific bad thing that happened?
