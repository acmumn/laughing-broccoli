## Minutes
- Storage space
  - Kelton: We used to have a bunch of room in the server closet but then we installed a second rack, so now there's a bunch of stuff just out in the room
  - Kelton: All the bins with ethernet cords, power cords, stuff like that. It's taking up a bunch of space and it kind of looks like a disaster zone in here
  - Mike: My opinion is that with the unprecedented times going on, we're not going to have members in the rooms so it's not a very pressing issue
  - Cole: we can probably shove it all into the battlestation corner, since it's not being used
  - Kelton: Oh yeah, that works. Issue resolved
- Rules for the room (social distancing, availability)
  - Kelton: Because of COVID we're going to need to have specific rules about how many people can be in the room, and where, etc
  - Mike: Before we were talking about limiting people in the room and requiring masks, but with how bad things are going, I think it's probably better not to have ordinary members in the room at all except for necessary things like the server maintenance
  - Kelton: I'm fine with that to start with. If things get better later on we can loosen up
  - Charlie: I think if at some point there's a vaccine or something we should still wait a few weeks before letting up
  - Mike: I think the webite already says the room is closed, so we can just leave that up
  - Kelton: That needs to actually happen by the way, currently you can just swipe in
  - Hemant: I can email the door guy again
- Inquiry emails
  - Kelton: We got a couple of emails asking what ACM's about and how to be an officer
  - Charlie: I can answer those emails
- Official Minecraft server
  - Mike: Do we not already have one of these?
  - Charlie: There's been one on acm.umn.edu for a long time, but there's also nothing on there
  - Kelton: I think if we leave one open an unmoderated we're going to end up with a bunch of swastikas
  - Hemant: We could also end up with some nice garfields
  - Mike: What do we want to do about a minecraft server? advertise it?
  - Charlie: I'm sort of uninterested in having an Official server
  - Kelton: I just put the topic in here because people were complaining about how many unoffial servers we have
- Server reprovisioning
  - Hemant: Our infrastructure is sort of fucked
  - Hemant: We're going to set up argo as a vm server, garlic is going to expose jupyter / nvidia-docker / etc
  - Kelton: Basically it's not going to be like "here's an account, have fun" anymore, instead the servers are going to have more specific uses and not be fucked
  - Hemant: The only thing that really needs to be discussed is downtime. We're planning on moving things over to another machine of ours, so the websites won't be down
  - Hemant: We're going to move member machines to a switch, so those won't be down either
  - Charlie: My machine doesn't have anything on it, so it's fine if it goes down
  - Hemant: Also apparently we're hosting UMN morris's official orientation minecraft server for some reason
  - Hemant: At some point during the semester all of our IP's will get switched around, so people with DNS stuff will need to update that
  - Hemant: Does the mail server need to be up for any short term reason?
  - Charlie: No, not really
