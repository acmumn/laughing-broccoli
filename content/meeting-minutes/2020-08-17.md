## Minutes
- New meeting time
  - Everyone: This time still works
- do we do MinneHack?
  - Charles: we talked a bit about this at coles house, most people said they didnt think we should do it.
  - Cole: I think the consensus we came to is that it's probably not happening
  - Mike: My worry is that if we don't do it this year, it'll be harder to get the ball rolling in the future
  - Mike: If we do anything, it would have to be online, we definitely can't do in person
  - Charles: I'm not particularly interested in hosting an online hackathon. I've never enjoyed doing them.
  - Hemant: We do still have Coffman reserved. We could do something in there
  - Cole: If we did do an online one it would probably be good to have like a livestream of us in coffman or acm
  - Kelton: Charlie's right though, online hackathons do suck
  - Cole: We could change the format so it's not just a bunch of people staying awake in their houses
  - Cole: I'm thinking like a jeopardy style hackathon with smaller prizes
  - Andrew: With an online hackathon there's less incentive to form teams, we'd have to think about that
  - Kelton: We could force people into team if they sign up as single riders
  - Mike: If it were me that would completely dissuade me from signing up
  - Kelton: Smaller projects would probably be harder to judge
  - Andrew: In jeopardy style ctfs there's some kind of baseline and you award points for if the submission meets it or not
  - Kelton: That could work. And you have very clear guidelines on what constitutes making uno
- ACM national memberships
  - Mike: We need the pres, vp, and treasurer to have acm national accounts. Currently it's still me helen and nathan, and mine is expired
  - Mike: We need to talk to shana about getting the dept to pay for that
  - Kelton: Who should be the Official treasurer?
  - Cole: You can do it if you want, I don't really care
