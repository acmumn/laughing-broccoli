## Topics for Discussion
- Sponsor for nts rollover

## Minutes
- Sponsor for nts rollover
  - Hemant: To be a private LAN under nts we need someone to be a sponsor for us in case me mess something up
  - Hemant: I think for us that person would be Mats or Jim something, so we'd need to talk to one of them
  - Louis: Jim seems like the better option to me
  - Hemant: Irene seemed to think Mats would be better since he's a department head
  - Louis: Ok that's fine
  - Hemant: NTS really doesn't want to give us a private LAN, they want to put us on a hybrid LAN
  - Hemant: Irene seemed to think that would be a bad idea since it would give us less control and we couldn't ever change back
  - Louis: When I talked to Mats it sounded like there would only be a problem if one of our machines got pwned, which hasn't happened in recent memory but has happened before
  - Louis: So I would be interested in finding out what happened last time and how that would change if we had a private LAN this time
  - Louis: Other than that this sounds sweet
