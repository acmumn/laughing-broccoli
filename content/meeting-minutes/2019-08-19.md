## Minutes
- Nathan: SSF update
    - Nathan: I was working on that, but then they took it off the website
    - Nathan: One new thing: somebody has to do a canvas course on that, probably me
    - Nathan: I didn't see anything too new on there
    - Helen: I assume the "new content" they're working on is just changing the dates for 2019
    - Nathan: I'm still reading up on it, I'll get back to it when they put it back up
    - Helen: When you find out what the deadlines are, make sure to let us know
    - Nathan: k
- Helen: Set up MinneHack meeting time
    - Mike: Is this something that more then the 4 of us should be here for?
    - Helen: Probably
    - Nathan: Related, does everyone have their schedules in the drive?
    - Nathan: There's a few people still missing
    - Nathan: Let's decide next week and make sure everyone puts their schedules in before then
- Louis: Door access grace period
    - Louis: The department wants to know the new door list, I told them to wait until we know who'll be on the new list
    - Louis: When is the cutoff for new members and for people to renew their membership?
    - Helen: One week after the school year starts
    - Nathan: Sounds good to me
    - Louis: That should also be in the newsletter
    - Louis: Do we know if anyone paid their membership over the summer?
    - Nathan: I'll try to check
- ~~Charles: Newsletters~~
- Ringo: Topgrade for weekly machine updates
    - Louis: I have no idea what that means. I guess I'll ask him
- Louis: Postman student expert program
    - Louis: Somebody emailed us to says they're impressed with out whatever, they want somebody to be an evangelist for them
    - Louis: I've never heard of them and I don't know what they do
    - Louis: I think we should probably just tell them that but in nicer words
- Louis: Big 10 CTF coalition
    - Louis: Some guy I know is starting a CTF advocacy group for the big 10 schools; since the U doesn't have a separate CTF group he contacted me
    - Louis: Seemed like a good idea to me but I don't know what the group is exactly
    - Louis: The guy wanted heads of CTF groups to be in an inner circle
    - Rain: Security is kind of my thing, I can be our spokesperson
    - Helen: It should probably be me or Louis, not a non officer
    - Louis: It seems like one of those things that's more of a discord server than a real thing
    - Helen: I can join the server and see if it becomes a real thing
    - Louis: Let's tell the guy that it seems like a great idea and we'll be in his org unless he asks for money
- Charlie: Mathnasium job posting
    - Mike: This seems like any other job posting, not anything that needs to be a meeting topic
    - Helen: Our response email should tell them that we're the wrong group and there are other, math specific groups on campus
- Charlie: Kirsten email
    - Helen: We need to meet with Kirsten about sponsorship stuff; I'll email her
- Nathan: Sue meeting
    - Nathan: Helen do you want to be there?
    - Helen: Yes but I probably can't on account of I am sick / out of town
- Nathan: Small fridge
    - Nathan: It's full of water and it smells bad
    - Louis: Let's just dump it out and bleach it next time we see Johannes
    - Louis: If we want to get rid of it I'll take it, but I think it's salvagable
