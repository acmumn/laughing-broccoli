 - Jack: Plumb bob update
     - Isai: Plumb bob says we wouldn't be financially supporting the Salvation Army, but we can support another charity if we want to
     - Helen: I think we should still not do it
     - Louis: I think we should still do it, unless we have a better reason not to besides "it's not fun"

 - Helen: Rules about member property being left in room
     - Helen: Members aren't supposed to leave their stuff in the room for long periods of time
     - Isai: Is this something we actually want to be enforcing?
     - Helen: I think we should, especially if it's food
     - Isai: Let's let the offending parties know about the new policy and let them know to stop leaving food here
     - Louis: I think people can leave stuff here, but only if they use it
     - Isai: That's unenforceable, let's just not allow it
 - Isai: Cadscom 2019
     - Isai: We were approached by the Minneapolis professional chapter to help host this
     - Isai: I went last year, it was pretty cool
     - Helen: They want us to reserve rooms, and they'll find sponsors
     - Isai: We got the okay from SUA as long as we're explicitly listed as a host and actually helping them run it
     - Isai: This is gonna happen in August. It won't take much, we just need to reserve the rooms
     - Isai: It'd we cool if some of our members presented stuff, we should let people know that this is happening
     - Helen: I'll email this guy and let him know we need him to come to campus so we can meet him
 - Isai: SUA postering
     - Isai: UMN eSports brought up the fact that SUA will put up posters for us if we give them posters
     - Isai: I'm going to tell Jack so he can put it in the wiki
     - Ringo: CC me on that so I can use it for the CTF 3 posters
     - Louis: Also, we should get the MinneHack ads off the TVs in the atrium
 - Isai: LAN party
     - Isai: We had the meeting with IEEE and the Gamers
     - Isai: We need to reserve the room, pretty much everything is staying the same
     - Isai: If you wanna be involved come to the meeting
     - Isai: IEEE is designing the poster again
     - Helen: We should insist on reviewing the poster before they post it
 - Isai: Officer elections
