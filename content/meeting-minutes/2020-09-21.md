## Topics for Discussion
- Hack the box CTF
- FAST trivia event

## Minutes
- Hack the box CTF
  - Hemant: Jeopardy-style ctf's are bad, i think a hack the box would be better
  - Kelton: we talked about this last time, i thought we decided to do that next semester
  - Louis: I don't know what you mean specificially by hack the box, like what the rules/goals would be
  - Louis: I was thinking a hybrid would be more fun, where we use jeopardy style scoring but the tasks are breaking into a vulnerable webservice
  - Kelton: i think if some of the problems for the jeopardy-style ctf were this, that would be fine
  - Andrew: I don't know if people will be able to do it, based on the skill-level of previous events
  - Hemant: CTF might be better if it were more educational anyway
  - Louis: If we keep running into the problem of people not being able to solve the problems, we might want to change the scope of the event
  - Hemant: Just based on how it went last year, we should change something even if the style stays the same
  - Andrew: We could have checkpoints in a hackthebox to sort of lead people through the process
  - Mike: So what have we decided?
  - Louis: I guess we've decided to do a jeopardy-style with some hackthebox problems
  - Kelton: I think a format change might be in order for next semester
  - Louis: The time isn't really a factor, since we haven't started on this one yet
- FAST trivia event
  - Charlie: FAST emailed wanting to do the resume event, but we're already committed to doing one with Target
  - Charlie: I told them we would be intersted in doing a trivia night, and suggested 11/5 at 5pm
  - Andrew: What would a trivia night even entail?
  - Kelton: I don't know, there's computer trivia we could ask
  - Cole: We could look online and find problems
  - Charlie: I think they have an event prepared
  - Charlie: I'll ask them if they can send us the questions ahead of time
