## Minutes
- Helen: Tom Quigley
  - Helen: We got an email advertising fundraising for [previous] MinneHack projects
  - Helen: I seems like he misunderstood what we do, I'm not sure how relevant this is to MinneHack
  - Helen: He wants us to advertise his grant to past participants whose projects had a conservation theme
  - Cole: That seems like it would influence people to do conservation projects once people see it
  - Mike: I think that's the idea
  - Helen: The point is to send it to past participants, like if anyone's 2020 project was conservation related
  - Charlie: I think we can just send it out in announcements. I'll do that right now
- Kelton: CTF
  - Kelton: I think we should be more firm about whether we are or are not planning to do CTF this year
  - Cole: It's currently scheduled for the 18th if we do decide to do it
  - Hemant: If we were going to do an online ctf it would have to be trivia style, which is boring 2 me
  - Kelton: I'm willing to write a bunch of ctf problems if we decide to do it
  - Helen: I think since nobody's especially enthusiastic we should punt on it for this semester
- Charlie: Tigergraph
  - Charlie: The Tigergraph event will be happening tonight. Please attend
  - Charlie: I'm going to post another announcement at 5:00
- Charlie: Movie night
  - Charlie: What movie?
  - Helen: I vote for Birds of Prey
  - Mike: Do we want to pick an R rated movie?
  - Helen: I like the movie
  - Cole: I have a copy available if we do choose bop
  - Charlie: I can work on making the stream more work better this week
  - Charlie: I think if we are clear about the content beforehand it will be fine
  - **on friday we will watch birds of prey**

## Things to say 
- ~~Talk to your (cool) CSCI professors about Donuts~~
- If you continually do not do your tasks, please ask someone to do them. It is better to have someone a little bit grumpy at you than for them not to get done.
