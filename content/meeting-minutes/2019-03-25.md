## Minutes
 - Isai: SSF request
     - Isai: Thomas and I submitted it over break
     - Isai: We asked for less money than last year for a few reasons (we don't have to pay for room rental, we can submit operation requests, etc)
     - Isai: We are having some trouble getting information from the department
     - Isai: We should probably think of a better way to get info in the future, because we gave them like two months
     - Isai: Now we're just waiting to see what the results are
 - Isai: Officer elections
     - Isai: Helen made a form for signing up to run for an elected position
     - Isai: I don't think people know they're supposed to be signing up to run
     - Isai: Let's put the link on the board just to get it more visibility
 - Ringo: Target event/advertising
     - Louis: We already had this discussion 2 weeks ago, let's just put up ads without Target's logo
     - Louis: We can also just put the Target logo on the poster and it won't hurt anything
     - Isai: Okay, have these printed out by 5:00 and we'll have hang them up
     - Louis: Related; we need to email people from previous CTF's soon if we're gonna do that
     - Ringo: Can someone commit to that by midnight?
     - Michael: I will do that
 - Ringo: General prospectus
