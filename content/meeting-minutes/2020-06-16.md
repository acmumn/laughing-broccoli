## Minutes
- Reassign TODOs?
  - Done, except for some long term stuff
- New meeting time?
  - whentomeet in brass-class
  - New time is Mondays at 5:00
  - Mike: I will change the calendar, website, etc
- Website problems
  - Charles: Is this the certificate?
  - Mike: That's one of them
  - Louis: The cert is renewed, it just doesn't automatically restart nginx
  - Louis: There's also definitely something wrong with dip
  - Louis: That should just get replaced, tbh
  - Cole: What is that?
  - Louis: It's the binary that pulls the repo and runs gutenberg when there's a new push
  - Mike: Is it possible to fix it in the meantime before it gets replaced?
  - Louis: I'll see what I can do
- Social distancing in the rooom
  - Mike: What should the new rules be?
  - Cole: WHat are the U's rules? Is it two meters?
  - Charles: This is still pretty far away
  - Cole: The U said they want all classrooms and clubs to be in compliance with their distancing rules
  - Charles: ooh
  - Mike: What are those policies?
  - Cole: I'm looking at my emails rn
  - Kelton: (reading from guidelines) "break rooms and gathering rooms should be closed for gatherings or whatever"
  - Charles: We should maybe say one person per individual table
  - Charles: We could probably get four at the big table, one at the battlestation, and one at the side table
  - Kelton: And probably a mask policy
  - Kelton: Probably no more eating in the room, since you'd need to take off your mask to eat
  - Kelton: We'll need to formalize this at some point
  - Cole: This probably doesn't need to be in the constitution, but we should post these rules on the door at some point
- Keybase
  - Mike: Someone who still talks to Ringo please make him stop being the owner of our keybase organization
  - Hemant: Are we still using keybase? I thought it was on the way out
  - Charles: We're not, but for now it's what we're still using
  - Cole: We tried to migrate to something else but nothing worked
  - Mike: The only thing we use keybase for in the first place is the passwords file, we could just move that somewhere else
  - Kelton: Someone could pretty easily make a flask whatever to host that
  - Hemant: We could also have an acm gpg key. we could even just export the keybase key
  - Cole: What if I don't want to use gpg, or i'm on a machine i don't want my key to be on?
  - (this didn't get answered we got sidetracked)
  - Mike: Andrew and Kelton msg me your keybase usernames so i can add you to the team in the meantime

## Things to say
- If you continually do not do your tasks, please ask someone to do them. It is better to have someone a little bit grumpy at you than for them not to get done.
