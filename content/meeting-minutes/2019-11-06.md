## Minutes
- Charles: Team drive
  - Charles: I tried to do the team drive. it turns out it's difficult, even with a chromebook
  - Charles: I will investigate further, but we might have to just leave the folder where it is and just use the drive going forward
- Charlie: Ecolab email
  - Charlie: They sent an email asking a couple questions, we should respond asap. Specifically re:booth
  - Mike: there are some pdfs in the drive that say floor plan. I think diagram 2 is the one that has all the actual booth locations on it.
  - Helen: Actually I think diagram 1 is better.
  - Helen: Anyway I think we should fix the diagram to be accurate for this year and send it to them.
  - Louis: Who's going to do that?
  - Charles: I can do that
  - Louis: Charlie, when you email them back, make sure you ask them what they mean specifically when they talk about the API
  - Helen: Who's in charge of the API stuff?
  - Ashmita: I will be the person they can ask if they have specific questions
  - helen: I think whta we tell them is we want to know what they are considering and we can try and make it relevant, but we can't guarantee.
- Charlie: MinneHack meeting
  - Charlie: do we still have a meeting?
  - Helen: Yes. It would be best if everyone could be there in person
  - Louis: I'm making a when2meet, everyone fill it out immediately so we can choose a new meeting time
- Louis: Meeting Time
  - Meeting Time Sucks
  - New When2Meet poll
  - Helen: move meetings to monday 6:30
  - Helen: MinneHack meetings stay where they are, and we talk about mh after normal meetings if need be
  - **Regular meeting now Monday at 6:30**
- Helen: ACM-W hack night
  - Helen: Can we do Hack nights at some time on thursday?
  - Ashmita: It's impractical to do it in our room because only two people have a key, and limited availability.
  - *general dissent for events in ACM room*
  - Louis: as long as it's low key...
  - Ashmita: its just a programming in the same space some times thing.
  - Louis: we can also put that on the calendar
