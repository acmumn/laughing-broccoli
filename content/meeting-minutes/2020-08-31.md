## Minutes
- SESB
  - Charlie: We got an email about the SESB meeting that happened, I don't know if we still care about those
  - Hemant: As the person who went to those last semester: no, we don't. It's all marketing stuff
- Membership
  - Charlie: I don't remember why I put this here
- Secretary
  - Charlie: Noor says she might be interested in being secretary and potentially webmaster in the future
  - Charlie: That's not actionable right now, I just wanted to bring it up
- Update Gopherlink/SSF contact
  - Kelton: We got an email telling us we need to do that
  - Mike: I already updated the gopherlink contacts, I don't know about ssf
  - Kelton: I think that's still nathan
  - Mike: Does anyone know how to make someone else the ssf contact?
  - Cole: I can include it in my email to Shana
  - Kelton: wait, there's a form I can just fill out right now
  - Cole: We also got an email saying ssf is getting pushed back two weeks with the start of the semester
  - Cole: That means we'll have to wait to get funds
  - Kelton: It does give us more time to think about what we want to request
- Money for server stuff
  - Cole: There are some servers in brass class we could request from ssf
  - Mike: Would we be spending money that we need for something else?
  - Cole: No, the only thing we ever buy normally is pizza
  - Louis: I'm always in favor of new servers, but we're reaching the point where we'll need to talk to the electrician about power in the closet
  - Louis: we should also make sure the existing servers are set up for people to use them before we ask for more, in case the department wants justification for more
  - Louis: We need to have a page where people sign up for server accounts we can point to
  - Kelton: So we're all agreed that we need more servers
  - Louis: What kind of servers do we want then?
  - Hemant: If we're going whole hog on virtualization I think we should get a cpu with a high core count
  - Louis: We might need to settle for just using garlic for now, it might look bad if we request the same thing twice
  - Andrew: I've sat in on a meeting before, it seemed like they were more interested in the ratio between number off students' fees we're spending vs how many students are impacted by the purchase
  - Louis: What I'm saying is that they do look at past reports to decide
  - Kelton: I think it might be a good idea to get more gpus for garlic, since some of the ones it's using now are member property
  - Cole: Do we have a machine that can handle running a webserver for online minnehack?
  - Louis: I don't know what we want out of the program, but any one of our machines should be able to do that pretty easily
- Waive membership fees update
  - Kelton: Currently there's no record of where the membership fees go after we get them
  - Charlie: I don't think that's a problem, the department handles all our money anyway
  - Kelton: So how do we buy things then?
  - Charlie: You submit a purchase request and then either they buy it for you or you check out the p-card
  - Kelton: If that's the case then I guess waiving membership fees is fine
  - Louis: There are also two strings, one for acm and one for minnehack, but there's one account
  - Louis: When you check out a p-card it's tied to an account string on the u's end, but to the merchant it's just a normal credit card
  - Kelton: I think we can just not collect membership fees and not have that money
  - Louis: I think we'll need to vote on the bylaws to approve that, but otherwise yeah
  - Kelton: If people have already paid before we change the rules we can just comp them for next time we charge fees
  - Louis: Ordinarily the reason we charge fees is to have some way to determine who gets door access, but since there's no room access this semester that's not a problem
- Outdoor meet ACM
  - Charlie: We should do something in the keller courtyard or in the mall where people meet but not too close
  - Kelton: I think the U sent us an email telling us explicitly not to do that for september at least
  - Charlie: Oh, okay
- IRC bridge permissions
  - Kelton: We already figured this out
- Set weekly hangout time
  - Thursday at 3pm
