## Minutes
- LAN Party
  - It is this Friday (it is happening)
  - Charles sent an email about tournaments and the discord, people have been joining
  - Mike: IEEE came in today sying that they did not get an email, but that they will still be helping
  - Charles: I just checked, they definitely did get emailed. It's Marie's fault that it didn't get to Arnav.
  - Helen: we should get fewer pizzas than we did for spring.
  - Discussed tournaments, layout, what hardware we'd be bringing, etc at the meeting on Friday. Minutes in the appropriate discord.
  - Helen: I emailed the chairs and tables guy, we will have chairs and tables
  - Helen: Who's free for setup?
    - Helen, Louis, Mike, Ace? (probably), Charles (after 4:30), Cole
- CTF
  - We have 1.5 problems from Louis, 1.5 problems from Hemant
  - Louis: I've been kinda busy, I can probably write 5-10 problems over thanksgiving
  - Louis: Problems should probably be bomblab-level difficulty or lower, because a lot of problems last year didn't get solved
  - Hemant: Michael also said he'd write some problems
  - Helen: I don't believe him
  - Helen: How are we feeling overall?
  - Louis: It'll happen
- Officers
  - Do your emails before leaving the meeting

- Helen: MinneHack shirts
  - Charles: The UGP quote comes out to 3100 for shitty gildan shirts
  - Charles: Brandmakers (the ones MLH recommended) come out to 2346.50 for the same shirts
  - Charles: Nice shirts from Brandmakers would be about the same as UGP's shitty shirts
  - Charles: They also said they'd give us a $0.25 discount per shirt if we let them add their logo
  - Louis: If they actually want their logo on our shirt for that little, you should tell them to go fuck themselves and look at our sponsorship tier outline
  - Charles: My quote is 2585 for the nice shirts I brought in that one time
  - Charles: It also looks like we're ordering more shirts than last time
  - Helen: Last year we got 440 shirts and had a significant amount left over
  - Charles: I can also do a quote for the not soft shirts real quick
