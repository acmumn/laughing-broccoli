## Minutes
- Louis: Smash Night
  - We should reserve a room and play smash in it.
  - Also other games on a projector
- Helen: OCR
  - Helen: OCR messed up, they let us reserve the atrium, but did not inform the TA's that we had reserved it.
  - Louis: This seems like something that has happened in the past.
  - Helen: we are emailing OCR about it.
  - Helen: Because of this we need to reserve LAN party as soon as possible.
- Helen: Atrium Reservation for Spring and Fall 2020
  - Louis: I will email them
- Hemant: Update Website
  - It's out of date
  - Louis: Ashmita, can you do that?

  - Louis: I will be writing a lot of problems over the weekend.
  - Hemant: same.
  - Ashmita: how's advertising.
  - uhhhh
  - Ashmita: I can make a poster right now.
- Nathan: SSF Update
  - Nathan: they are officially done with their allocation. We got all of the money except for bus.
  - Nathan: we also did not get the 10G equipment. Otherwise, we did get all the stuff.
  - Mike: how much MinneHack money>
  - Nathan: $7391
  - Nathan: the justification for rejecting the networking equipment makes no sense. I will try to appeal the decision.
- Nathan: Spring Events
  - Nathan: we should plan them.
  - Nathan: room reservation opens on dec 3.
  - Adding paper pals. different ctf, add MH, no SDC. otherwise same as other years.
  - Charles: Track event. Could have a structured presentation then mingle time with pizza.
  - Nathan: could be good to have alumni come in as well.
  - Charle: could we get money for spring.
  - Helen: The department would probably love to jump on this bandwagon.
- Charlie: Officer
  - Charlie: I will be gone next semester. I just found out a week ago.
  - Cole: I can be an officer.
  - Charles: Cole, we can do a shuffle, and I can be the corporate ambasador.
  - Nathan: I don't think I want to be a treasurer next year.
  - Helen: We could employ treasurer minions to help you.

- Also, MinneHack Meeting.

## Things to say
- Talk to your professors about Donuts
- If you continually do not do your tasks, please ask someone to do them. It is better for them to get done and have someone a little bit grumpy than not have money for MinneHack.
