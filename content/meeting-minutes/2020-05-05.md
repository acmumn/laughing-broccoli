## Minutes
- Officer elections
    - Mike: Have we asked if people are interested in running yet?
    - Cole: No, I can send an email with that form
    - Mike: And have we decided where/how we're holding the election? I think gopherlink isn't ideal because nobody uses it
    - Kelton: I think Hemant was putting everybody on gopherlink
    - Mike: The last I heard he had removed everyone and was gonna invite all our paid members to (re)join
    - Hemant: I did that, yes
    - Mike: What percentage of our paid members accepted the invitation to rejoin?
    - Hemant: I don't know, but I also don't think it matters if people who don't care don't vote
    - Mike: Sounds fine to me
    - Cole: I can send the email if someone helps make the form
    - Hemant: We also got an email from acm telling us we're missing members
    - Nathan: That's just because our terms expired, we can fix that after elections
- Movie night movie
    - Mike: I think Fargo's good
    - Kelton: I'm fine with that
    - Cole: Cool

## Things to say
- If you continually do not do your tasks, please ask someone to do them. It is better to have someone a little bit grumpy at you than for them not to get done.
