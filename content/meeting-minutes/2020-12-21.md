## Minutes
- Shana meeting
  - Hemant: Shana wants to meet with us, we should make a whentomeet for next semester
  - Mike: Ok, I can do that
- MinneHack:
  - Cole: I feel like we should have our run of show hammered out now or soon
  - Louis: Can we get a registration update as well?
  - Mike: For the run of show, we don't have to worry about meal times or sleeping, right? So it should just be opening statements, hacking, and judging
  - Cole: What's our sponsorship situation like? In case anyone wants to do a workshop
  - Charlie: I don't think that's super urgent, there's a lot of open space we can slot people into
  - Louis: I think we should still have mealtimes on the schedule, so we can schedule around them for social events
  - Hemant: Registration is currently at 50
  - Mike: Do we need to work on writing the submission system, since things will be different this year?
  - Charlie: No, devpost should still work fine for that
