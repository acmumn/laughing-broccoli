## What is SDC?

The Software Design Competition, or SDC for short, is like a
hackathon in miniature. Students are tasked with designing a piece of
software to solve a problem. They then create a concept and prototype
a solution to fit the requirements of the problem.

### How does it work?

The competition is spread over two weeks. During the first week,
competitors ideate and design their concept. New this year,
competitors can use the second week to implement a prototype of their
idea.

### What do I need to participate?

Participation is absolutely free! All you need is a computer, some
spunk, and a handful of good ideas.
