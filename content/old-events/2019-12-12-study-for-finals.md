## What's this about?

We're providing food, company, and a space! Bring yourself, your textbooks, and your friends. Some ACM members might be available to give pointers or help out on classes they've taken before.

## What are you studying for?

While most attendees will probably be studying for CSCI classes, you are welcome to study for anything!
