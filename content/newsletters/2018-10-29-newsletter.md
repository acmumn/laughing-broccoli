Following this week's meeting, The judges will decide on the overall first and second place winners of the competition. If you aren't at the presentation, you won't be able to receive your prize, even if your team wins, so please make sure you're there! Mesa pizza will be provided. See you there!

 - **Capture the Flag Kickoff:**
   - The kickoff for our CTF will be held on November 8th in Keller Hall 3-125 from 7:00 to 8:30 PM. CTF, short for capture-the-flag, is a cybersecurity competition in which participants try to evade security protections on certain exploitable targets to obtain secret information known as flags. During this first meeting, we'll be holding a kickoff event where we'll do a gentle introduction to CTF. The competition will then run on for the rest of the week online. If you're interested in competing, visit [our website](https://acm.umn.edu/events) for more information.

   - ACM UMN's systems committee is currently looking for more members. If you have experience with systems administration or are willing to learn, come to our room and talk to one of our current systems committee members.
