Hello ACM UMN members,

Here are some of the events we have coming up in the next few weeks:
 
 - **Fall LAN Party:**
   - On November 16th from 6:00 PM to 2:00 AM, ACM, IEEE, and UMN Esports will be hosting a LAN party in the Keller atrium. There will be tournaments set up for popular video games such as Overwatch, Hearthstone, Rocket League, and more. Free pizza and soda will also be provided. You can also feel free to just bring your computer and hang out. Join the LAN party [Discord server](https://z.umn.edu/LANdis) if you're looking for a team or are interested in participating in one of the tournaments. Come by and unwind before midterms.

 - **ACM Servers:**
   - ACM UMN maintains several servers that our members can use for personal projects. If you have a program/website/etc you want to host, but don't have your own server to run it on, contact a member of the systems committee by email or discord to activate your account on our servers. You must be a paid ACM UMN member to activate your account.

 - **Systems Committee Recruiting:**
   - ACM UMN's systems committee is currently looking for more members. If you have experience with systems administration or are willing to learn, come to our room and talk to one of our current systems committee members. Systems committee meetings are 3:30 on Saturdays via voice call (#general-voice in Discord), but subject to change; PM Louis, Michael, or Nathan if you're interested in attending and would like to be informed of scheduling changes.

If you want to get more involved with ACM UMN or see what weâ€™re up to, you can stop by our room, Keller Hall 2-204, any time. In addition, our weekly officer meetings are held on Mondays at 7:00 pm in Keller Hall 2-204, and our meeting minutes can be found [on our website](https://acm.umn.edu/meeting-minutes). You can also join our [Discord server](https://z.umn.edu/acm-discord).

Have a great week!
