Here are some of the events we have coming up in the next few weeks:

Epic is a company that makes healthcare software for mid-size and large medical groups, hospitals and integrated healthcare organizations. Representatives from Epic will be talking about building security into enterprise applications. Among the topics discussed will be the technical challenges of implementing something as simple as secure passwords, emerging models for mobile device security, and the implications of security breaches. There will also be free pizza and a chance for attendees to to ask any questions they might have. If you're interested in computer security or would like to learn about it, make sure to stop by.
