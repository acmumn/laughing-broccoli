Also, later in the semester, we will be hosting another CTF! This will be "trivia-style" online sets of cybersecurity challenges that competitors complete on their own to earn points, the winner being the team with the most points after a fixed amount of time. These challenges are practical applications of skills including cryptography, networking, web security, stenography, scripting, and more! We are running one of these events on December 3rd, 2019. This is a low-key event, and would be a great first practical security experience!
