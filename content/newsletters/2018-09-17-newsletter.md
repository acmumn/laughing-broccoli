Hello ACM UMN members,

Here are some of the events we have coming up in the next few weeks and months:

 - **Polaris Think Talk:**
   - On September 20th, ACM UMN will be hosting a Think Talk with Polaris from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm in Bruininks 220. A representative from Polaris will be talking about Machine Learning and App Development. To learn more about Polaris, stop by the Think Talk and talk to the Polaris representative. Mesa pizza will also be provided.

 - **UNIX Classes:**
   - ACM UMN is teaching UNIX classes on Fridays in Mechanical Engineering room 108 from 12:00 to 1:00. This week we are teaching our second UNIX Class on git and GitHub. If you've never really used UNIX or the command line before, this is a great primer. Mesa pizza will also be proved. We will have vegan and vegetarian options available. No prior knowledge of UNIX is required, just bring yourself, your computer, and a hunger for pizza.

 - **Code42 Site Visit:**
   - Code42 is interested in hosting our members at their Minneapolis headquarters on September 28th from 1-3 P.M. There will be a tour of their facilities and a meeting with some of their dev team and their leadership. Read more about Code42 on [their site](https://www.code42.com/about-code42/). Please let us know if you are interested as soon as possible by filling out [this RSVP form](z.umn.edu/acm42).
