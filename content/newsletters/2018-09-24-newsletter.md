Hello ACM UMN members,

Here are some of the events we have coming up in the next few weeks:

 - **Coffee & Donunts with the CS&E Department**:
   - Come grab some refreshments and meet professors, researchers, advisors, and other students in the computer science and engineering department. This event will be held in the main floor of Keller Hall, above the atrium on Tuesday, September 25th.

 - **UNIX Classes:**
   - ACM UMN is teaching UNIX classes on Fridays in Mechanical Engineering room 108 from 12:00 to 1:00. This week we are teaching our third UNIX Class on vim. If you've never really used UNIX or the command line before, this is a great primer. Mesa pizza will also be proved. We will have vegan and vegetarian options available. No prior knowledge of UNIX is required, just bring yourself, your computer, and a hunger for pizza.

 - **Code42 Site Visit:**
   - Code42 is interested in hosting our members at their Minneapolis headquarters on September 28th from 1-3 P.M. There will be a tour of their facilities and a meeting with some of their dev team and their leadership. Read more about Code42 on [their site](https://www.code42.com/about-code42/). Please let us know if you are interested before Wednesday by filling out [this RSVP form](z.umn.edu/acm42).

If you want to get more involved with ACM UMN or see what weâ€™re up to, you can stop by our room, Keller Hall 2-204, any time. In addition, our weekly officer meetings are held on Mondays at 7:00 pm, and our meeting minutes can be found on our website. You can also join our Discord server.

Have a great week!
