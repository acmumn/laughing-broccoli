Hello ACM UMN members,

Here are some of the events we have coming up in the next few weeks:

 - **Officer Elections:**
   - ACM UMN will be holding officer elections for next year very soon. If you would like to run, you can sign up in our room in Keller Hall between now and 4/8. You must be a paid member of ACM UMN to vote in our officer elections.

 - **Spring LAN Party:**
   - ACM UMN, IEEE, and UMN eSports will be hosting a LAN party in the Keller atrium on 4/12 during CSE week. We will be having tournaments for Hearthstone, Overwatch, League of Legends, and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. If you would like to compete in any of these tournaments or just want to attend, please [join the LAN party discord](https://z.umn.edu/LANdis). There will be free pizza and soda.

 - **CTF 3:**
   - We will be hosting a 3rd capture-the-flag (CTF) cybersecurity competition at some point in the future. Unlike the previous two CTF's we've hosted, this CTF will be a six-hour, in-person event. If you would like to compete, please fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/MPz7RHfvXckZQr123) with your availability so that we can choose a date for the event.

Non ACM UMN Events:

 - **ACM-W Hack Day:**
   - The UMN’s ACM-W Chapter is coming together with student groups on campus and nonprofits in the community to bring you a day of coding for the community! Join us for our first annual Hack Day on April 13th from 9am to 4pm for a day of fun, friends, food, and coding! This event will be held in Bruininks 330.

If you want to get more involved with ACM UMN or see what we’re up to, you can stop by our room, Keller Hall 2-204, any time. In addition, our weekly officer meetings are held on Mondays at 2:30 pm in Keller Hall 2-204, and our meeting minutes can be found [on our website](https://acm.umn.edu/meeting-minutes). You can also join our [Discord server](https://z.umn.edu/acm-discord).

Have a great week!
