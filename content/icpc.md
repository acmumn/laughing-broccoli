# International Collegiate Programming Contest

The **International Collegiate Programming Contest**, or ICPC for short, is a prestigious international algorithms competition hosted by the ACM national organization. The objective of the competition is to write programs to solve problems as accurately as possible within a certain time limit. Programs will be graded by computerized judges and tested on a wide variety of cases. The team that is able to solve the most number of problems wins!

The competition is held in two stages: regionals, and world finals. Qualifying teams from regionals will be eligible to compete in the world finals in Beijing, China.

## Participating

If you're a student at the University of Minnesota and you're interested in representing the university at ICPC, you're in luck! We will be sending several (specific amount pending) teams to the nearest ICPC regionals event to qualify for the world finals.

## Practices

We will be hosting several practices as a means of building interest for the competition, as well as matching players who are looking for teams. These will be held in (location?).
