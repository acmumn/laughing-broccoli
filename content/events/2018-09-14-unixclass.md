## What are the UNIX Class Topics?

The first UNIX Class will be on shell basics! If you've never really used UNIX or the command line before, this is a great primer.

## What do I need to know before I attend?

No prior knowledge of UNIX is required! Just bring yourself, your computer, and a hunger for pizza.

## What dietary restrictions do you cater to?

We always have vegan and vegetarian options! We also (usually) bring lactaid for people who like cheese pizza, but cannot consume lactose. 

If you are gluten free, let us know in advance and we will do our best to accommodate you.

## When are the UNIX Classes?
The first UNIX Class is September 14th from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm. The next UNIX Classes will be in the same time and place, just one week later. (9/21, 9/28, 10/5).

## Where are the UNIX Classes?
Mechanical Engineering 108 for all dates.
