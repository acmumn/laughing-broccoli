## What is SDC?
The Software Design Competition, or SDC for short, is like a
hackathon in miniature. Students are tasked with designing a piece of
software to solve a problem. They then create a concept and prototype
a solution to fit the requirements of the problem.

### How does it work?
The competition is spread over three weeks. During the first week,
competitors ideate and design their concept. Competitors can use the
second week to implement a prototype of their idea. Everything comes
together in the third week for final judging.

### What do I need to participate?
Participation is absolutely free! All you need is a computer, some
spunk, and a handful of good ideas.
