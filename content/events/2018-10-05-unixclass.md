<!-- more -->

## What are the UNIX Class Topics?

The fourth UNIX Class will be about pipes and filters in the terminal! This will build on the first, second, and third classes, though attendance of those is not required.

## What do I need to know before I attend?

It will be helpful to have some knowledge of UNIX or have attended the first three classes. All you need to bring is yourself, your computer, and hunger for pizza. 

## What dietary restrictions do you cater to?

We always have vegan and vegetarian options! We also (usually) bring lactaid for people who like cheese pizza, but cannot consume lactose. 

If you are gluten free, let us know in advance and we will do our best to accommodate you.

## When are the UNIX Classes?
The fourth and final UNIX Class is October 5th from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm.

## Where are the UNIX Classes?
Mechanical Engineering 108
