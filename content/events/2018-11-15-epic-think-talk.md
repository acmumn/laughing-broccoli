## What is this talk about?

Epic makes healthcare software for mid-size and large medical groups,
hospitals and integrated healthcare organizations, where the stakes
for securing and protecting information are incredibly high. In this
talk, we’ll discuss the technical challenges of implementing something
as simple as secure passwords, from hashing itself, to hash function
conversions to choosing the right encryption algorithms and
protocols. We’ll explain emerging models for mobile device
security. And finally, we’ll focus on the implications of security
breaches.

As a global leader in the development of software for healthcare
organizations, Epic is driving change for an entire industry – one
that affects the quality of life for everyone. Our team collaborates
with some of the world’s most respected healthcare organizations to
