### Partners
#### Target
Founded in 1962 as a subsidiary of Minneapolis-based Dayton Department
Stores, Target has a long history of exceptional shopping experiences
and community involvement. We've grown from a single store in suburban
Minneapolis to more than 1,700 stores in the U.S., and we're now the
second largest retailer in North America.
