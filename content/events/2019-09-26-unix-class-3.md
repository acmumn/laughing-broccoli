## What are the UNIX Class Topics?

The third UNIX Class will be about process management. This will build on the first two classes, though attendance of it is not required.

## What do I need to know before I attend?

It will be helpful to have some knowledge of UNIX or have attended the first two classes. All you need to bring is yourself, your computer, and hunger for pizza. 

## What dietary restrictions do you cater to?

We always have vegan and vegetarian options! We also (usually) bring lactaid for people who like cheese pizza, but cannot consume lactose. 

If you are gluten free, let us know in advance and we will do our best to accommodate you.

## When are the UNIX Classes?
The third UNIX Class is September 26th from 6:00 to 7:00 pm. The next UNIX Class will be in the same time and place, just one week later. (10/3).

## Where are the UNIX Classes?
Keller 2-260 for all dates.
