## What are the UNIX Class Topics?

The second UNIX Class will be on more advanced UNIX topics! This will build on the first class, though attendance ofit is not required.

It will be helpful to have some knowledge of UNIX or have attended the first class. All you need to bring is yourself, your computer, and hunger for pizza.

If you are gluten free, let us know in advance and we will do our best to accommodate you.
