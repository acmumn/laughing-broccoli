You Can join our IRC by clicking this link: [ircs://acm.umn.edu:6697](ircs://acm.umn.edu:6669)

If that doesn't work, and you use the weechat irc client, you can connect by typing (or pasting in) these commands:

```
/server add acm acm.umn.edu/6697 -ssl
/connect acm
/join #general
```

# Tips


The most active channel by far is `#general`. Most of the time when people say "the irc", they mean `#general`.
you can enter `/list` once you are connected to the server to see all of the channels. 
Most of the channels outside of `#general` are channels that are connected (bridged) to the discord. 
The briged  channels other than `#discord-general` are password restricted, as they are member only. 
For access to these, ask an officer or someone in the IRC.
